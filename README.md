#### An internet-enabled footbag, which provides a stream of live motion sensor data.
This is our project for the Appfolio March 2016 24-hour Hackday.

Using an ESP8266 board, paired with an LSM9DS0 Accelerometer/Gyro/Mag sensor (9DOF), we intend to build a hacky sack that can provide a live stream of sensor data, based on how it moves during a normal game.
